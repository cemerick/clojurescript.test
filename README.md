# clojurescript.test [![Travis CI status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cemerick/clojurescript.test.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/cemerick/clojurescript.test/builds)

A maximal port of `clojure.test` to ClojureScript.

## Why?

I want to be able to write portable tests to go along with my portable
Clojure[Script], and `clojure.test`'s model is Good Enough™ (it's better than
that, actually).  Combine with something like
[cljx](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx) or
[lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild)'s crossovers to
make your ClojureScripting a whole lot more pleasant.

## Installation

clojurescript.test is available in Maven Central. Add this `:dependency` to
your Leiningen `project.clj`:

```clojure
[com.cemerick/clojurescript.test "0.0.1"]
```

Or, add this to your Maven project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.cemerick</groupId>
  <artifactId>clojurescript.test</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

clojurescript.test provides roughly the same API as `clojure.test`, thus making
writing portable tests possible.

(Note that `clojurescript.test` doesn't take any
responsibility for any hosty or otherwise-unportable
things you do in your tests, e.g. `js/...` or naming JVM types or Clojure- or
ClojureScript-only functions; either don't do that, or use something like cljx
to include both Clojure and ClojureScript code in the same file.)

Here's a simple ClojureScript namespace that uses clojurescript.test:

```clojure
(ns cemerick.cljs.test.example
  (:require-macros [cemerick.cljs.test :refer (is deftest with-test run-tests testing)])
  (:require [cemerick.cljs.test :as t]))

(deftest somewhat-less-wat
  (is (= "{}[]" (+ {} []))))

(deftest javascript-allows-div0
  (is (= js/Infinity (/ 1 0) (/ (int 1) (int 0)))))

(with-test
  (defn pennies->dollar-string
    [pennies]
    {:pre [(integer? pennies)]}
    (str "$" (int (/ pennies 100)) "." (mod pennies 100)))
  (testing "assertions are nice"
    (is (thrown-with-msg? js/Error #"integer?" (pennies->dollar-string 564.2)))))
```

You can load this into a ClojureScript REPL, and run its tests using familiar functions:

```clojure
=> (t/test-ns 'cemerick.cljs.test.example)

Testing cemerick.cljs.test.example
{:fail 0, :pass 3, :test 3, :error 0}
```

All of the test-definition macros (`deftest` and `with-test`, as well as the
`set-test` utility) add to a global registry of available tests (necessary given
ClojureScript's lack of namespaces), so you can also define, redefine, and run
tests interactively:

```clojure
=> (deftest dumb-test
     (is (empty? (filter even? (range 20)))))
#<[object Object]>
nil
=> (t/test-ns 'cemerick.cljs.test.example)

Testing cemerick.cljs.test.example

FAIL in (dumb-test) (:0)
expected: (empty? (filter even? (range 20)))
  actual: (not (empty? (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18)))
{:fail 1, :pass 3, :test 4, :error 0}
```

### Using with lein-cljsbuild

Most people use [lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild) to
automate their ClojureScript builds.  It also provides a test runner,
originally intended for use with e.g.  [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) to
run tests that use existing JavaScript test frameworks.  However, you can
easily use the same facility to run clojurescript.test tests.

This is the lein-cljsbuild configuration that this project uses to run its own
clojurescript.test tests (look in the `project.clj` file for the full monty):

```clojure
:plugins [[lein-cljsbuild "0.3.0"]]
:hooks [leiningen.cljsbuild]
:cljsbuild {:builds [{:source-paths ["src" "test"]
                      :compiler {:output-to "target/cljs/testable.js"
                                 :optimizations :whitespace
                                 :pretty-print true}}]
            :test-commands {"unit-tests" ["runners/phantomjs.js" "target/cljs/testable.js"]}}
```

Everything here is fairly basic, except for the `:test-commands` entries, which
describes the shell command that will be executed when lein-cljsbuild's test
phase is invoked (either via `lein cljsbuild test`, or just `lein test` because
its hook is registered).  In this case, it's going to run the `phantomjs.js`
script (which shebangs to `phantomjs`), which will load the output of our ClojureScript
compilation, run all of the tests found therein, report on them, and fail the
build if necessary.

Feel free to grab the `runners/phantomjs.js` script for your own projects (or, even
better, figure out a way to easily package it with clojurescript.test itself,
so only one such script will need to be maintained, etc).

**Wanted: runners for other JavaScript environments, e.g. Rhino, XUL, node, etc**

## Limitations

* Bug: filenames and line numbers are not currently reported properly.

## Differences from `clojure.test`

* docstrings bear little to no semblence to the library's actual operation
* Namespace test hooks must be defined using the `deftesthook` macro

### Runtime

* `*report-counters*` is now bound to an atom, not a ref
* `*testing-vars*` now holds symbols naming the top-levels under test, not vars
* `*test-out*` is replaced by `*test-print-fn*`, which defaults to `nil`, and
  is only bound to `cljs.core/*print-fn*` if it is bound to a non-nil value.
* `run-tests` is now a macro; `run-tests*` does the same, but does not offer a
  no-arg arity
* `use-fixtures` is now a macro, and there is no underlying multimethod to
  extend as in `clojure.test`.

### Errors

* Stack traces from caught exceptions are obtained via
  [`Error.stack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Stack),
which appears to only be supported in Chrome, FF, Safari, and IE 10+. The value
of `Error.stack` in Rhino (at least, the version specified for use by
ClojureScript) is always an empty string; other JavaScript environments may be
similar.
* File and line numbers of reported exception failures may be missing in
  JavaScript environments that do not support the `lineNumber` or `fileName`
properties of `Error`.

### Removed

* `*load-tests*` is now private, and will probably be removed.  The use case
  for Clojure (which is rarely taken advantage of AFAICT) seems irrelevant for
ClojureScript; if you do or don't want tests in production, you just change
your cljsc/lein-cljsbuild configuration.
* `file-position` was already deprecated and unused
* Not applicable
 * `get-possibly-unbound-var`
 * `function?`
 * `*stack-trace-depth*`
